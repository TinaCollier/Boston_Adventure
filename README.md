# Boston_Adventure

This is my routing program to help a Boston visitor plan their route along the Red Line to get to various landmarks. 

## How To Play

1. Start the game with `python3 Boston_Adventure.py`
2. Choose your starting point by typing the letter that represents your current landmark.
3. Choose your ending point by typing the letter of your next landmark destination. *The program will give you every station stop on the way to your destination.*
4. Decide if you would like to go to another landmark. Type `y` for yes and `n` for no.
5. If you choose yes, the program will ask if you would like to see the list of landmarks again. Choose yes or no.
6. Choose if you would like to change your origin `o`, destination `d`, or both `b`. 
7. Repeat steps 2 through 6. 

## Why This Program?

I wanted to showcase my ability to create a graph and use both breadth first and depth first searches. I included three dictionaries along with the graph search functions and imported these into my routing program. I really enjoyed our visit to Boston last month and I wanted to memorialize our trip using my program.
